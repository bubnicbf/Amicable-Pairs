# Amicable-Pairs
Calculates the Amicable pairs under a number p=20000

Two integers $N$ and $M$ are said to be amicable pairs if $N \neq M$ and the sum of the proper divisors of $N (\sum(propDivs(N))) = M$ as well as $\sum(propDivs(M)) = N$.

For example 1184 and 1210 are an amicable pair (with proper divisors 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 37, 74, 148, 296, 592 and 1, 2, 5, 10, 11, 22, 55, 110, 121, 242, 605 respectively).
